# Chord (DHT)
This repository implement a simple version of the [Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)) algorithm.
The provided code already setups the ring network properly.
1. Supports Node Joins
2. Finds the correct successor for a node
3. Run Stabilize periodically to correct the network

## Course
This project was developed under the Distributed Computing course of [University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/).
